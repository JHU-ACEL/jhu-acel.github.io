Welcome to the Autonomous Control & Exploration (ACE) Lab at Johns Hopkins University! Our lab is focused on developing safe and compuationally efficient algorithms for robot decision making. In particular, we leverage tools and theory from machine learning, optimization, and control that enable autonomous systems to operate safely under sensing and action uncertainty and by leveraging multiple modalities of information such as language and vision. Our work is broadly applied to a host of systems, including surface rover vehicles, satellite rendezvous-and-proximity operations, aerial robots, among others.
